Double Blind Secret Santa Pairng with SMS Alerts

# Ho Ho Ho
Ever want to set up a Secret Santa pool for your family? What about a Secret Santa Pool where you could:

1. Double-blind the selection process,
2. Avoid sharing everyone's information to a third-party website to do the pairing for you,
4. Specificy pairings that cannot happen (e.g. make sure there are no Husband-Wife pairings.)

Well then - Ho Ho Ho - check out SecretSantaPy. Secret Santa Py is a little script I wrote for my family Secret Santa exchange. In it you can secificy who can and cannot be paired, perform the pairings, and then notify everyone via SMS via a Twilio number.
